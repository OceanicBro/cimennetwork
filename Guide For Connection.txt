Hello. This is the guide for usage of Cimen Networks.

STEP 1:

You have to download files, security patches too.

STEP 2:

Open your hardware/emulator. If emulator, go to your real device's Internet settings. If real hardware, go to Internet settings (If it has).

STEP 3:

Open my files and provided "RunServers.exe".

STEP 4:

A wired/wireless connection has such names like "SERVER-0948".

STEP 5:

Connect and give the token (You can see in cnct.json) as password.

BOOM! Connected. If this is YOUR friend connecting, give them the token and files. Also, these files will detect if it is you or your friend.

No connecting? Support files will come soon. MADE BY: OceanicBro on GitHub.
